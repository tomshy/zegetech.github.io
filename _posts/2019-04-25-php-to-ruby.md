intro: Learning anything new has always been an uphill task for normal guys, I don't know about those with humanly insane IQs like [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking). A good example is trying to learn a new language like Spanish if you are a Swahili speaking native. I don't know Spanish so I won't say much about it but the undisputed truth is that communication in spanish is 98% similar to that in Swahili with little differences in things like gender specificity. The huge difference comes in how they structure the wordings. Same thing to programming languages.

## My experience

My primary development language has been PHP with Laravel being my main framework of development until I got lucky and got introduced to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) by our CEO Kariuku Gathitu 3 months ago. Lucky because of the sweetness and joy that Ruby brought into my development life!
