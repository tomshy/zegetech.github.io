intro: Learning anything new has always been an uphill task for normal guys, I don't know about those with humanly insane IQs like [Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking). A good example is trying to learn a new language like Spanish if you are a Swahili speaking native. I don't know Spanish so I won't say much about it but the undisputed truth is that communication in spanish is 98% similar to that in Swahili with little differences in things like gender specificity. The huge difference comes in how they structure the wordings. Same thing to programming languages.

All programming languages comply to the [Turing Completeness phenomenon](http://wiki.c2.com/?TuringComplete). So, technically anything done in language A could be done in language Z.

## My experience

Well, the focus of this piece isn't really confined to PHP developers moving to ruby but rather the switching between any language. I'm just putting the piece into context from what I have gone through in my transition.

PHP has been around for decades and it poses an easier roadmap for new developers to get into the world of web development because of its huge and well developed ecosystem. It's normally the first web programming language programming newbies are introduced to.

My primary development language has been PHP with Laravel being my main framework of development until I got lucky and got introduced to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) by our CEO Kariuku Gathitu 3 months ago. Lucky because of the sweetness and joy that Ruby brought into my development life - it is literally structured in a way that makes developers feel happy, few lines of code, lots of gems etc. I believe its creator, [Yukihiro Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) created it to make developers happy.

But before the sweetness came the struggle of understanding how Ruby is structured, it's installation, gems(ruby libraries - literally has a gem for most things a developer could want), rails framework, installation, dependencies etc.

From what I went through I believe that it would be easier for the newbies in programming to dive into ruby than for intermediate programmers switching to ruby. The challenge for the intermediate programmers is that they always write the new language code with their old language style which isn't always compatible. They are so used to a single language that shifting to another language becomes an uphill task especially if the said languages are so different in their style of doing things. Perhaps the trick would be to unlearn the programming style of say the verbose way of doing it in PHP and learn the new robust programming style like Ruby's.     

But hey, don't be scared, I just said ruby brought much joy to my development life and the 2 languages are kind of similar in some ways. 

### Here are the ways in which the 2 languages are similar:
- They are both interpreted languages
- They are both Object Oriented languages with classes, variables and methods having the 3 access control methods - private, protected and public; abstraction, inheritance and other OOP featues working the same way
- They are both dynamically typed languages, so no declaring variable types like in java. You simply declare a variable For example:

```
age = 10 #ruby
$age = 10 #PHP
```
- Both have `true` and `false`
- Arrays and hashes work in the same way

### Differences?
Definitely, yes! The easily notable differences between the 2 languages include:
- ruby files use `.rb` while PHP use `.php`
- commenting
```
# this is a comment in ruby 
// this is a comment in php
```
- Everything in Ruby is an object including strings, numbers, hashes, arrays. That's why when converting between 2 data types, oftenly called as type casting, here's what happens:

```
age.to_s # in ruby
strval($age) # in PHP or 
(string)$age 
```

```
age.length # in ruby
strlen($age) # in PHP
```
- parentheses are not necessary in method calls unless arguments are required, unlike in PHP where you need to include parentheses in method calls. For example:

```
get_age #method call in ruby
get_age() #method call in PHP
```
- ruby doesn't have statement terminators like `semicolon(;)` in PHP. Starting a statement on a new line depicts end of statement
- `dot(.)` operator is used for concatenation in PHP unlike ruby which uses `plus`. For example:

```
# PHP
$age=10
echo "I am ".$age." years old" 

# ruby
age=10
puts "I am "+age.to_s+" years old" # note the explicit type conversion in ruby. Unlike in # PHP which does an implicit type conversion 
```
- ruby uses `do and end` pair keyword as well as `braces {}` to show code blocks, PHP uses `braces {}` only to show code blocks

- in ruby [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) is the way to go while in PHP either type hinting - ***defining type of arguments to pass in a method call*** or duck typing can be used but with care on the kinds of exceptions that may be raised.

```
# duck typing in ruby

def get_age(person)
    return person.age
end

# type hinting in PHP

function get_age(PersonObj $person){
    return $person->age()
}

```
- debugging in PHP can get a developer in deep pain. If using Xdebug things can get really tough especially when setting it up. If not using Xdebug, var_dump() is an option but this entails numerous browser refreshing which is just a nuisance. Debugging in ruby is simplified. Ruby has got several gems specifically for code debugging. Such gems include byebug that are very simple to use. You simply bundle install the gem, include it in the development and test group and use it by calling `binding.pry` on a file you want to debug.
- shorter lines of code in basic programming statements like for loops. 

```
# php
for ($num = 1; $num <= 10; $num ++) { 
    echo "$num \n"; 
}
# ruby
(0..10).each do |i| puts "#{i}" end
```
- exception handling in PHP uses the `try/catch` block while ruby uses `begin/rescue` blocks

```
# in PHP
try{
    do_something();
}catch(Exception $e){
    echo "exception handled"+$e
}

# in ruby
begin
    do_something
rescue SomeException
    puts "exception handled"
end
```
- in PHP, composer is used to manage application libraries while ruby uses bundler that manages the ruby gems, tracking versions compatibility of the gems and updates the gems upon availability of newer versions.
- function declaration in PHP is done using `function` keyword enclosing the function body in braces while ruby uses `def` keyword as follow:

```
# in PHP
function get_age(){
    echo $age
}

# in Ruby
def get_age
    puts age
end
```
- and so much other differences in things like arrays, hashes(called associative arrays in PHP), control statements, OOP features, namespacing

## Why Ruby

Let's now delve into the cookie part of ruby.

#### Code Quality
Reliability, maintainability and readability all characterize good code. Ruby was designed in a way that made achieving high quality code easier. A ruby developer doesn't even require years of experience before writing good code. With practices like separation of business logic from MVC implementation, use of problem detection gems and test automation, writing good code is assured.
#### Tools
Ruby provides a [respository](https://rubygems.org/) of libraries called gems that techinically help developers do more in less time. There's a gem for almost anything you could think of. Think of any functionality, type it into the Ruby repo and boom, you'll be surprised of the number of options available. 

Another plus is that gem installation is quite simple. All you need to do is type into your command line:

`gem install gem-name`

or simply include it into a Gemfile if using RoR and use bundler by running `bundle install` in your command line.

#### Community
With the ever growing Ruby community and ruby boasts of a large developer community. We now have Ruby communities in almost every part of the world. One close to my locality is [Nairuby](http://nairuby.org/). The repos on Github are also on the rise, SO also on the rise. The good thing with the Ruby community is that most it has developers who have a good grasp of the language, so expect help from people having a deeper understanding of the language

#### Test automation
Ruby is widely known for its TDD approach in development. It heavily focuses on testing and makes the process simple. It boasts of simple to use test automation tools like Minitest and RSpec that allow developers to write automated tests easily. 

Example in Minitest:

``` 
test "A is equal to B" do
    assert_equal(A, B)
end
```
#### Security
Ruby also provides tools that help ensure the security of your application. With tools like Brakeman and Rubocop, static code analysis is enabled. This helps ensure that a developer writes code that is tamper-proof and prevent hacker activities in production.
#### Built for the future
With so many startups preferring Ruby as their primary programming languages, I would say Ruby was built for the future. Statistics also show that most developers are interested in learning Ruby, online learning platforms are also getting more people joining Ruby classes now than before. This just proves that in the coming years Ruby will take the lead. 

Notable companies in the global and local markets using Ruby and RoR include:

##### Global Companies
[Github](https://github.com/)<br>
[Airbnb](http://airbnb.com/)<br>
[Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)<br>
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/)<br>
[Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/)

##### Local Companies
[Andela](https://andela.com/)<br>
[Fuzu](https://www.fuzu.com/)<br>
[Mfarm](http://mfarm.co.ke/)

Everyone is moving to Ruby, why don't you? 
## PHP vs Ruby

|| PHP | Ruby |
| --- |---|---|
| Github Repos| 138,000 | 132,000 |
| Famous sites| Facebook, Udemy, Wikipedia | Twitter, Hulu |
| Popularity| More popular(large developer community) | Less popular |
| Jobs Posting| 21% | 3% |
| Ease of development| Takes time | Saves time |
| Famous Web Framework| Laravel, others: codeignite | Ruby on Rails, others: Sinatra |

## Takeaway

Don't be lured into the jackpot thing that brings instant gratification because it never works. Ever heard of ```RoR in 7 days```? As [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) puts it, those are SCAMs. When transitioning to language B, start with a beginners mindset, have a book in place or official docs is to understand the architecturing of the syntax and semantics, read lots of code in that language from hubs like github, codeplex etc; understand the programming paradigm; do something small but useful projects in that particular language; have learning timeboxes and deploy ready timeboxes; don’t cram the syntax it will eventually stick, blog about something new you learn - it will come in handy greatly because incase you miss anything in the near future(it happens) you quickly refer to the blog piece instead of jumping right to google where you may get varied solutions of your problem; recreate something from your “used-to” language in your new language, seek a mentor and just practice.
