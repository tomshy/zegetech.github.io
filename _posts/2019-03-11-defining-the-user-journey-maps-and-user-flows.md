intro: Among the many tasks involved in software design phase there is user journey mapping. This is the design that tends to answer how your product's user will achieve the core goal of using your product. In this piece, we will get to understand what this means, why it's important to do a user journey/flow design, how it's done and sampling of the best user flow design tools highly recommended by [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) designers.

User journey mapping is part of product design phase that aims at visually depicting a target user's walkthrough of a product. It's a visual representation of the persona manourvering through a product solution in a clear and logical path to goal accomplishment. It outlines the entry points, processes, decision making, actions, outputs and exit points of a product solution with a keen focus on the pains, joy, feeling questions and the general user experience of the product. 

Here's an example of the general user journey overview of an ecommerce website:

It's also used to provide a high-level communication to product stakeholders on how the user really makes his way through the product solution to goal achievements therefore helping the stakeholders understand the the solution flow from the user's point of view. 

Here are some insights on what makes the user journey:

#### Entry Points
What's the first thing an end user does when they discover a product? Well, this is your persona's entry point. This is the point that invites the end user to the product's functionality. You want to keep your end user? Focus should be here. Pay attention to the look and feel of your entry point, focus on things like the speed of loading up the product, color schemes, arrangement of your product components - for example always placing login on top of your landing page or make it more visible if it's somewhere else, you don't want to get your user frustrated on the very first stop at your product.There's a lot to be considered here. The trick is to think like a marketer focusing on window shoppers - the goal would be to convert a window shopper.

#### Processes
This is now the real juice of your product. They represent the actual actions that an end user performs with hopes of attaining the final goal, for example the actions that would lead your user in buying an item from an online shop. Keep them clear, logical and engaging. Make them appear as if there's a virtual user talking to your end user. Focus on the end users experiences, feelings and perceptions relative to their needs and goals while going through the processes. The simple and clear actions really determine the conversion of a user. 

You can optionally provide chronological guides that would help your end user in browsing through the product easily. 

#### Decision making and loops
These are the cyclic engagements of the user while taking actions on the product. They represent the various options available to a user in taking certain actions. They can be really useful in cases where a user is caught up in seemingly un-ending decision making. This can illuminate the product designers decision to escalate the user's frustration into 'critical level' and assign the user to customer support for a more direct and personal help.

#### Outputs
These are the messages the user gets after taking a certain action. They include either success messages or error messages. In either case, the output should be clear and informative to avoid user confusion.

#### Exit Point
They represent the final point of your user's journey. At this point, always ensure that the user's goal has been accomplished. This will really determine whether the user makes a revisit to the product or not. 

Always keep in mind that a user's journey continues even after accomplishing a task and exiting the product. The tendency is that a user would recommend the product to others or not. 

## How is it done?
With the advent of technology and simple look up on the internet, you'll come across various design tools used. From my UX design experience and research on top design tools used by UX designers, [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Lucid chart](https://lucidchart.com), [creately](https://creately.com), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com) and [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com) top the list of the best [UX design tools](http://uxtools.co/tools). However, don't jump right into the online tools. 

First, make a research on the user's needs, perceptions and pain points in accomplishing a goal. You can also map out your competitor's user journey during your research if it proves to be more revealing about a user's needs, perception and pain points. Look into what keeps users sticked to a competitor's product, observe the mechanisms used by competitors in achieving great user experience and much more. Doing the research will really help you in understanding the user well, what a user does inorder to accomplish a goal, a user's happy moments and much things about the user which will eventually lead to mapping out the user journey perfectly. The more you understand the journey, the higher the chances of designing a perfect user journey.

Then, have sketchy designs drawn on a piece of paper then transfer them onto your favorite digital design tool. Having the sketchy designs on a piece of paper or on sticky notes makes it easy to change the designs before transfering the final designs to an online design tool.

To make the process simple, I have it broken down to these sub-processes:
- **Identify your persona**. This is your target end user. According to your product, map out and organize your persona according to age, location, gender, goals, devices in use etc. 

- **Define your persona goal**. This answers the question `what does my target user want?` For example, `To Send money to My Contacts`, if you are building a digital money transfer app.

- **Define the processes and actions**. These are the specific actions or steps the user would take to meet a certain goal.

- **Define the user flow.** Draw out the user processes into a logical user flow diagram that shows the process flow from beginning to the end. Always keep in mind the scope of your goal to ensure that the users go through less steps decision making and actions in meeting their goals.

*Tool used - Creately*

- **Draw the wireflows and mockups.** From the user flow defined in the previous step, draw out wireframes and mockups for the specific processes and actions. These are replicas of the end product. They will help in validating the user journey visually and determine whether it needs optimization or not.

*Tool used - Creately*

- **Refine the wireflows and mockups into clickable mockups that depict a user journey** This will create a visual narrative of the end product. It will help bring out the feel of the actual product and how the user will actually use the product in meeting his goals.

## My advice on creating a good a user journey/user flow...
- keep it simple
- see it through your user's eyes
- keep it goal specific
- ensure it has all the important details needed
- ensure you use conventional diagrams in creating the designs

...because the point is to always provide the shortest and simplest steps that will help your end user move from point A to Z.

The evident and most important reason for user journey mapping is to help product developers design products that meet user needs without much hustle with the long term goal of achieving target users' loyalty.
