intro: Among the many tasks involved in software design phase there is user journey/user flow design. This is the design that tends to answer how your product's user will achieve the core goal of using your product. In this piece, we will get to understand what this means, why it's important to do a user journey/flow design, how it's done and sampling of the best user flow design tools highly recommended by [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) designers.

Product design is the second phase in the product development lifecyle. It comes right before the development phase to ensure an efficient and fast development phase of the product. It also helps in catching bugs that would not have been caught during development. People, mostly developers find this phase boring and in most cases would be tempted not to do it but they will surely come to appreciate it when transfering their mental design solution to code. In most cases, this kind of approach will result in much product changes during the development phase which will actually slow down the whole product development process. It is therefore highly recommended that product stakeholders ensure a detailed design phase session. Get the mental solution to paper or digital design resource and use it in the development phase. You'll see how amazingly fast it will be.

## What is user flow/user journey design?
This is the visual representation of the persona manourvering through your product solution in a clear logical path to goal accomplishment. It outlines the entry points, processes, decision making, loops, outputs and exit points of a product solution. It's also used to provide a high-level communication to product stakeholders on how the user really makes his way through the product solution, hence acting as a bridge between developers and product stakeholders/clients. It is similar the flows you always create on whiteboards during meetings with product stakeholders. So, relax and hold your breathe, you already know it. 

## How is it done?
With the advent of technology and with a simple look up on the internet, you'll come across various design tools used. From my UX design experience and research on top design tools used by UX designers, [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Lucid chart](lucidchart.com), [creately](https://creately.com), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com) and [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com) top the list of the best design tools. However, don't jump right into the online tools. First, have sketchy designs on a piece of paper then transfer them onto your favorite digital design tool. 

To make the process simple, I have it broken down to these four sub-processes:
- Define your persona goal. This answers the question *what do you want to do?* For example, __To Send money to My Contacts__, if you are building a digital money transfer app.
- Define the task/process flows

- Define the wireflows and mockups.

- Refine the wireflows and mockups into clickable mockups that depict a user journey

## My advice on creating a good a user journey/user flow...
- keep it simple
- ensure it has all the important details needed
- ensure you use conventional diagrams in creating the designs
